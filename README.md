# DNATriplex

A simple GUI application built with Tkinter for analyzing DNA sequences from FASTA files. This tool allows users to load 3 FASTA files, input a codon, and visualize occurrences and similarities between sequences.

## Features

- Set a codon to search for in the sequences.
- Specify a highlight color for the codon.
- Load up to three FASTA files.
- View the codon count, positions, and the sum of position differences for each sequence.
- Calculate and display similarity percentages based on codon occurrences.
